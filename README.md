# DetectionAnalysis
Basic script and functions for evaluating a detection algorithm on MEArec ground truth recording files 

## Getting Started

- Install all depedencies (spikeextractors, numpy, h5py, ast, scipy).

- Use notebook to run and evaluate a basic detection example (specify the MEArec data path).

- Create, run, and evaluate your own detection algorithm.
